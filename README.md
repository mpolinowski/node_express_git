# node_express_git
##A Node/Express Library App with MongoDB (Training)

 This code is part of a training in web development with **Node.js**. **EJS** will be used as template engine for rendering HTML out of **Express**. The library application will use **MongoDB** to store information about books and authors - but will also employ the [GoodReads API] (https://www.goodreads.com/api) to provide more details on each. **Passport.js** will be used for local security.
